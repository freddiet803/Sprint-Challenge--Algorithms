#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - because the while loop is going to run while the variable is less than one. n-1, or n for linear

b) O(n log n) - because the for loop will run n times and the while loop runs while less than n but increments its counter by 2 each time. log n -

c) O(n) - the recursive function will run n times

## Exercise II

I think we could find the middle of the list or floors and drop the egg if it breaks then we know we need to go lower and should find the middle of the already lower section or if the egg doesnt break then we can go to the higher half and find the middle to find the floor the egg wont crack on. a binary search is implemented, log n
